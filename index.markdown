<h1>{{ "Mashweb.club" }}</h1>
is a website being built to help everyone build her/his/their own
*web applications* (web apps).
To make it simple to create a web app,
as it always should have been&mdash;
so simple that practically anyone can do it&mdash;
very unique technology is being developed and premiered on this website.
Let's repeat that. We're not just talking about creating websites.
There are plenty of easy to use services for that.
We're talking about full-fledged web apps.
While the definition of *web app* is not clear cut,
what we mean by it is a highly interactive web-based application,
not just a few web pages that query databases hidden behind web servers.

We hope that Mashweb.club and its technology will empower many people
who understand the importance of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
movement and its important principle,
[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)&mdash;
Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.
The IndieWeb and POSSE will help to foster
educated democracy, common ground, and shared perspective,
which are being destroyed by the influence of the corporate algorithms
of social media and web search engines.

Mashweb.club is in its pre-alpha stage of development.
Zen is a major part of its development plan;
*Zen* is the name of the unique technology being developed for Mashweb.club.
Zen's purpose will be to enable
the evolution of websites and web applications
in a profoundly personal, easy, and adaptable way.
The source code of various prototypes of Zen will be migrated onto
[Mashweb.club](https://mashweb.club)
and will be made available in the
[Mashweb.club code repository](https://github.com/Mashweb/mashweb.club).
As of now, the best documentation on Zen can be found in its
[white paper](whitepaper.html).

<h2>Inspirations and Demo Prototypes</h2>

The [demos & docs](/) section of Mashweb.club has a few experimental
prototypes of some user interfaces that might be used by Mashweb.club
when the website's unique technology is finally realized.
It also presents some of the inspirations behind the prototypes.

1. [a very simple demonstration](experiments/NodeLists/NodeListDMI.html)
that the blocks making up a web page
can be manipulated by simply sliding them,

1. a prototype of [the same demo](experiments/movies/NodeListDMI_installed_in_Facebook.mov)
installed in the web browser to manipulate a Facebook page,

1. [the inspiration](experiments/NodeLists/15-puzzle.html)
behind the block-sliding demo,

1. [a more freeform demo](experiments/NodeLists/blocks+inlines.html)
to explore the issues that crop up when designing a user interface
to move any block on a page,

1. [an exploration of cursors](experiments/NodeLists/css-custom-cursor.html)
to explore the hints about the functions of
a user interface that they can give the user,

1. a very simple and limited demo of
[repositioning an inline block](experiments/NodeLists/inline.html),

1. a prototype of [element highlighting](experiments/layout-visualization/element-outliner.html), and

1. a prototype of [element highlighting](experiments/layout-visualization/node-browser.html) showing what it might look like if all web page elements
were showed distinctly.
