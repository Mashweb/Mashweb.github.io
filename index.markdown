<h1>{{ "Mashweb.club" }}</h1>
is a website devoted to the development of a very simple to use
but very powerful place for everyone to build her/his/their own website
or *web app*.
It uses very unique technology to make this simple,
as it always should have been, so simple that practically anyone can do it.
Let's repeat that. We're not just talking about creating websites.
There are plenty of easy to use services for that.
We're talking about full-fledged web apps.
While the definition of *web app* is not clear cut,
what we mean is highly interactive web-based applications,
not just a few web pages that query databases hidden behind web servers.

Mashweb.club is in its pre-alpha stage of development.
Zen is a major part of its development plan.
Zen's purpose will be to enable
the evolution of websites and web applications
in a profoundly personal, easy, and adaptable way.
The source code for various prototypes of Zen is being migrated into the
[Zen project](https://github.com/tomelam/zen).
So far, the best documentation on Zen can be found in its
[white paper](whitepaper.html).

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
