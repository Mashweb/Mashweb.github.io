		    The current version of the prototype NodeList-manipulator prototype can only move
		    the child elements of a single element. In this demo page, that parent element is
		    the part with a light gray background. It is an &lt;article&gt; element.
		    This sentence text is represented by one or more TextNodes in the DOM whose parent
		    is the &lt;article&gt; element, so when you pass the mouse
		    over the sentence, the whole &lt;article&gt; element gets highlighted.
		    <hr>
		    <p>(Note: a paragraph begins here.) As you pass the mouse pointer over any child element in the gray-background &lt;article&gt; element, that child will be highlighted by an aqua border of 3 pixels and a margin of (at least) 2 pixels. Please try it. Another thing to try is clicking on a paragraph or line in the light-gray part of the web page&mdash;without moving the mouse. You will see a red border around the area where you can drag the paragraph or line and a cursor indicating the directions in which you can drag it.</p>
		    <p>Here is a second paragraph. Any paragraph or horizontal line inside the red box can be dragged and dropped after any paragraph or line inside the blue box. Please try it. (Note: This paragraph contains some inline elements&mdash;an image and a span, which are here to support tests of a future DMI GUI that can handle both block elements and inline elements. Inline-element handling is not supported for this web page yet. Here is the image: &nbsp;<img src="images/birds.png" style="height:62px; width:80px; vertical-align:text-top;"></img>&nbsp;<span class="elem">Here is the span.</span>)</p>
		    <p>Here is a third paragraph. You will see that when you click on a paragraph or line inside the blue box and drag the mouse upward or downward, you get feedback to <em>show</em> that you are dragging the paragraph or line; however, the NodeList position of the paragraph or line is affected only until the mouse button is released. Then the paragraph or line is removed from the DOM and re-appended after another paragraph or line and its position value is returned to what it was before the drag procedure.</p>
		    <p>This is the last paragraph in the first <span class="elem">&lt;article&gt; element</span>.</p>
		    <hr>
		</article>
		
		<article>
		    <h2>TODO</h2>
		    (This is another <span class="elem">&lt;article&gt;</span> element.)
		    <p>It is easy for a user to miss the fact that the <span class="elem">&lt;hr&gt;</span> element above can be selected by the mouse because it does not have much height. Any element with a small computed value for its height will present the same difficulty. It might be a good idea to set a minimum height of about 5 or 10 pixels to every element.</p>
