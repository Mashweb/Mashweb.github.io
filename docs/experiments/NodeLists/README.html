<h2>Display property</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>For blocks, the default width is 100% and the default height is 0.
A block does not share the line with other (sibling?) boxes.
This is the default.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline boxes expand horizontally and vertically to contain their child nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>An inline-block can have height and width and can share
the line with other boxes.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Position property</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>static</em> means "in the flow, taking a place on the row"; the default</p></li>
<li><p><em>relative</em> means "in the flow, but can be displaced relative from
where it would have been with <em>right</em>, <em>top</em>, etc. set to 0"</p></li>
<li><p><em>absolute</em> means "out of the flow, not taking a place on the row,
displaced from its nearest ancestor that is relative or absolute",
display forced to block type</p></li>
<li><p><em>fixed</em> means "out of the flow, not taking a place on the row,
displaced from the window", display forced to block type</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Interactions</h2>

<p>Interactions between <em>display</em> and <em>position</em> properties are shown in
<a href="https://youtu.be/juAquKMGUU0">Dave Fisher's "CSS Display and Position property interactions"
video</a>. This is not considering
the <em>float</em> or <em>z-axis</em> properties.</p>
